## Changes Made
I made changes to the patterns for detecting open() and os.path.join() calls to identify issues in the vulnerable path_traversal program. I used pattern-either to match calls that contained some variable input or a combination of variable and constant input. For example, such as, open($X), open($X + "..."), os.path.join($X) or os.path.join("...", $X) because these cases make the program vulnerable. I used pattern-not to avoid detecting false positives such as constant only expressions. For example: open("..."), open("..." + "..."), os.path.join("..."), and os.path.join("...", "..."). These patterns will flag lines 4,8,16,17,20,21 and 25 but it will ignore lines 12 and 24. This ensures that the vulnerabilities (nonconstant input) that exist in the program that can make the program unsafe, are properly flagged.
