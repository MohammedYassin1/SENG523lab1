The original yaml file for exercise 4 had two separate rules for eval and exec. These two functions are similar so the same rules and patterns were created for both. 'Patterns:' defines a list of patterns that need to be matched for the rule. 'Pattern:' describes what the rule is looking for, 'eval/exec' defines that it is looking for calls of the eval/exec function. '$VAR' defines that it is looking for a variable in the first argument position. The '...' defines that there can be anything after the variable. I did this so global and local variables can still be passed as arguments to the eval/exec function and the rule will still catch variables as the first argument. 'Pattern-not' is used so that it will exclude matches of the defined pattern. '"..."' is used to match any string literal that would be passed as the first argument. Only string constants were accounted for since exec/eval expects a string as its first argument. It will also account for constant propagation so it will catch any variable that is used but was defined by a constant string. '...' is used for the same reason as above.
